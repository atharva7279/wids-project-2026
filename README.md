Re-Mind: Agentic AI Chatbots using Gemini & Streamlit

This repository contains my implementation of the Re-Mind project, an agentic AI tutor system built using Google Gemini, Streamlit, and Python. The project explores how chatbots can maintain memory, track time, and take autonomous actions such as quizzing the user based on past interactions.
